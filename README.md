Unsupervised-Machine-Learning: Myopia Clusters
Background

The purpose of this assignment was to process raw data to fit the machine learning models. Several clustering algorithms were used to explore where the patients could be placed into distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. All in effort to predict myopia, or nearsightedness.

Steps

Part 1: Prepared the Data

Used Pandas DataFrame to read in the myopia.csv file
Removed unecessary column from dataset
Standardized dataset
Part 2: Applied Dimensionality Reduction

Performed dimensionality reduction with PCA
Reduced the dataset dimensions with t-SNE
Created a scatter plot of the t-SNE output

Part 3: Performed a Cluster Analysis with K-means

Created an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters

Part 4: Place the patients into 5 clusters!
